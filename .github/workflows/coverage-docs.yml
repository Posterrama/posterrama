name: Coverage Docs (Disabled - Fake Data)

# ℹ️ This workflow is disabled because:
# - Coverage reports on GitHub use fake test data
# - Tests run without real API credentials
# - Coverage metrics are meaningless without real integration tests
#
# Real coverage can be generated locally with:
#   npm run test:coverage
#
# This requires private/test-credentials.json with real credentials.
