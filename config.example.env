# Additional Operational / Security Notes
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Set NODE_ENV=production in production environments.
# - SESSION_SECRET can be autogenerated but persisting it keeps sessions valid across restarts.
# - ADMIN_* values are managed through the setup flow; leave blank initially.
# - Do not commit the generated .env file.
