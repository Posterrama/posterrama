- `script.js` (2,760 lines) ‚Üí Component-based architecture

**Target structure:**

```
js/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/           # State management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/              # UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/           # Media handling
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wallart/         # Wallart mode logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/               # Admin interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screensaver/         # Main display logic
